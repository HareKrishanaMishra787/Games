Python Turtle Games Collection
This repository contains three classic arcade-style games built using Python's Turtle graphics library:
<br>
üêç Snake Game
A classic Snake game where you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The game keeps track of your score and high score.
Features:

Snake movement controlled by arrow keys
Score tracking and persistent high score saved to file
Collision detection with walls and snake's own body
Growing snake mechanics when food is eaten

üèì Pong Game
A recreation of the classic Pong arcade game for two players.
Features:

Two-player controls (Right paddle: Up/Down arrows, Left paddle: W/S keys)
Score tracking for both players
Ball physics with increasing speed as the game progresses
Collision detection with paddles and walls

üê¢ Turtle Crossing Game
A Frogger-style game where you control a turtle trying to cross a busy road.
Features:

Turtle controlled by the Up arrow key
Randomly generated cars with different colors
Increasing difficulty levels (cars move faster) as you progress
Game over when turtle collides with a car

How to Run the Games

Make sure you have Python installed on your system
Clone this repository
Navigate to the project directory
Run any of the games using Python:

bashCopypython main.py  # Run the Snake game
# or
python F:\...\main.py  # Run the Pong or Turtle Crossing game
Project Structure

Snake Game:

main.py - Main game loop and setup
snake.py - Snake class implementation
food.py - Food class implementation
scoreboard.py - Score tracking and display
data.txt - Stores the high score


Pong Game:

main.py - Main game loop and setup
padle.py - Paddle class implementation
ball.py - Ball class with movement and collision physics
score.py - Score tracking and display


Turtle Crossing Game:

main.py - Main game loop and setup
player.py - Player (turtle) class implementation
car_manager.py - Car generation and movement
scoreboard.py - Level tracking and display



Dependencies
The games use Python's built-in libraries:

turtle - For graphics and game objects
time - For game timing
random - For randomization of food/car placement

Screenshots
The repository includes screenshots of all three games in action.
Learning Objectives
These games demonstrate:

Object-oriented programming in Python
Game development fundamentals
Event handling and user input
Collision detection
File I/O for score persistence
